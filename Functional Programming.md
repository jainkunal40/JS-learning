Lesson 1:

In javascript functions are value just like any onther premetive values.
Functions are composed together to make development more faster, less buggy and more understandable.
Composition is puting different functions together using higher order functions.
Abstraction: Hide implementation details, making code easier to understand.

A higher-order function is a function that:
Takes one or more functions as arguments.   
Returns a function as its result.   

example of higher order functions are filter, map, reduce etc
example filter is a higher order function that expect another callback function.
